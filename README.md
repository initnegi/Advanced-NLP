# Advanced NLP for Real-World Applications

This repository showcases advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques applied to real-world data. The project covers end-to-end pipelines for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, named entity recognition, and text summarization using state-of-the-art models like RoBERTa.

**Project Repository:** [https://github.com/initnegi/Advanced-NLP](https://github.com/initnegi/Advanced-NLP)

## Tasks Implemented

1. **Sentiment Analysis with RoBERTa**
   Fine-tuned a RoBERTa model to classify over 1.6 million tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

2. **Topic Modeling using LDA**
   Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover key themes in sustainability-related tweets.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   Extracted named entities such as products, organizations, and locations using spaCy’s pre-trained NER pipeline.

4. **Text Summarization**
   Fine-tuned a transformer model on BBC news articles to generate human-like abstractive summaries.

## Dataset Sources

* **Twitter Dataset:** 1.6M tweets filtered using sustainability-related keywords.
* **BBC News Dataset:** Articles with human-written summaries for training and evaluation of the summarizer.

## How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/initnegi/Advanced-NLP
cd Advanced-NLP
